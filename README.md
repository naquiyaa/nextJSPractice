The task was as follows:
There is a page with the url: http://localhost:3000/blog
On this page we have the featured blogs, latest blogs and a button to show all the blogs.
When the "show all" blogs button would be clicked, the "show all" button, latest blogs and featured blogs would be hidden and "all blogs" would be displayed. 
Moreover, the url should be changed to: http://localhost:3000/blog?allBlogs
However, the page must not be rendered again. 
Therefore this is what this small project is trying to achieve.
